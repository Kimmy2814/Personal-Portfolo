        <p class="about">I’m Julianne Kim Macayan, a 22-year-old third-year Computer Science student at Cavite State University–Bacoor Campus. I somehow ended up in this course, and now I’m just trying to survive it one "bahala na si Batman" moment at a time. Coding? Eh. Not exactly my passion — but hey, I’ve made it this far, so I must be doing something right (or at least not crashing every system I touch).</p>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My full name is Julianne Kim Macayan. I’m 22 years old and currently a third-year college student taking up a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Cavite State University – Bacoor Campus.<br><br>

I consider myself a friendly person who enjoys spending time with those I’m close to. However, I also have an introverted side and value my quiet space. Honesty and respect are important to me — both in how I treat others and how I hope to be treated in return. I find peace in music and nature, and I genuinely love helping others, even in small ways.<br><br>

To be honest, I don’t have a strong passion for coding or for the course I’m currently taking. But I’ve made it this far, now in my third year of college, and I’m manifesting that I will graduate. I may not be the most critical thinker or the most confident speaker, and I tend to overthink things or feel shy in large groups, but I always try to keep pushing forward.

Deep down, I dream of becoming a successful businesswoman someday. That dream is what keeps me going. I believe that even if the path I’m on isn’t perfect, I’ll eventually find my way to the life I’ve always envisioned.<br><br>

I come from a simple and loving family. My father works as a supervisor in a food company, while my mother is a former overseas Filipino worker (OFW). I have three siblings, and we live together in Bacoor, Cavite.

        <h2>Future Plans in Life</h2>
        <p>While I may not see myself pursuing a long-term career as a developer, I’m committed to finishing my current degree and making the most of the opportunities it brings.
